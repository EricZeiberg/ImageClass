# ImageClass
A KNN regression classifier for images and labels written in Python and NumPy

_This code is in heavy development at the moment, so all issues will be closed until a stable version is released_

_Code derived from [here](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/image-classification-in-Python.html)_


#### What exactly is this?
This code allows you to train a modal to recognize and label images based on training data. This is very useful for automatically reading CAPTCHAs and other cool stuff that I'm sure people will think of. 

#### Requirements
All the requirements to run this code are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the root. Convinently, you can pass this file into pip and it will automagically install all of them for you. Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
